### Context of the Problem

The problem involves determining whether it is possible to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a set of observations \( X_i \) when it is known that the data follow a uniform distribution on the interval \([0, \theta]\). The catch is that the original data is lost, but the sample mean and sample variance have been retained.

The question is whether you can still construct a valid 95% confidence interval for the mean using the information provided, particularly given the nature of the uniform distribution.

### Specific Terms, Math Expressions, and Notations

1. **Uniform Distribution on \([0, \theta]\)**:
   - **Expression**: \( X_i \sim \text{Uniform}(0, \theta) \)
   - **Explanation**: This means that each \( X_i \) is equally likely to take any value between 0 and \( \theta \). The distribution is flat, meaning the probability is evenly spread across the entire interval.

2. **Sample Mean (\( \bar{X} \))**:
   - **Expression**: \( \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \)
   - **Explanation**: The average of the observed values. In the context of a uniform distribution on \([0, \theta]\), the sample mean provides a straightforward estimate of the central tendency.

3. **95% Confidence Interval**:
   - **Explanation**: A range of values that is likely to contain the true population mean with a 95% confidence level. For a uniform distribution on \([0, \theta]\), the mean is \(\frac{\theta}{2}\), so the confidence interval involves estimating \( \theta \) first.

4. **Estimate of \( \theta \) using \( \bar{X} \)**:
   - **Expression**: \( \hat{\theta} = 2\bar{X} \)
   - **Explanation**: Given that the mean of a uniform distribution on \([0, \theta]\) is \( \frac{\theta}{2} \), you can estimate \( \theta \) as \( 2\bar{X} \). This allows you to construct a confidence interval for the mean.

### Explanation with an Analogy and a Quantitative Example

**Analogy**:
Imagine you are trying to estimate the maximum weight that a group of children can carry, knowing that the weight each child can carry is uniformly distributed between 0 and some unknown maximum value, \( \theta \). You’ve asked a few children and found their average carrying capacity, but unfortunately, you've lost the individual data points. However, with the average alone, you can still estimate this maximum weight.

**Quantitative Example**:
Suppose you sampled 10 children, and the average weight they can carry (sample mean) is 5 kg. The children’s carrying capacities are uniformly distributed between 0 and \( \theta \).

- **Step 1: Estimate \( \theta \)**:
  Since the mean of a uniform distribution \( \text{Uniform}(0, \theta) \) is \( \frac{\theta}{2} \), you can estimate \( \theta \) as:
  \[
  \hat{\theta} = 2\bar{X} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ kg}
  \]

- **Step 2: Construct a Confidence Interval for the Mean**:
  Even with the individual data lost, you know that the population mean for the uniform distribution is \( \frac{\theta}{2} \). So, the 95% confidence interval for the mean would be based on this estimated \( \theta \).

Since \( \hat{\theta} = 10 \text{ kg} \), the confidence interval would be centered around \( \frac{\hat{\theta}}{2} = 5 \text{ kg} \), with the interval size depending on the sample size and the variance.

### Conclusion:
You can still construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean of the \( X_i \)s even if the original data is lost, as long as you have the sample mean and understand the uniform distribution's properties. Specifically, using the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) and knowing the distribution is uniform allows you to estimate \( \theta \) and then create the confidence interval based on this estimate.

### What Does It Mean to "Construct a 95% Confidence Interval"?

Constructing a 95% confidence interval involves calculating a range of values, based on sample data, within which you can be 95% confident that the true population parameter (such as the mean) lies. Here’s a breakdown of what this means:

### 1. **Confidence Interval Basics**
   - **Confidence Interval (CI)**: A confidence interval is a range of values derived from sample data. It provides an estimate of a population parameter, such as the mean or proportion, along with an indication of the uncertainty associated with that estimate.
   - **95% Confidence Level**: This level indicates that if you were to take 100 different samples and construct a confidence interval from each sample, approximately 95 of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

### 2. **Interpretation of a 95% Confidence Interval**
   - **Range of Values**: The confidence interval consists of two bounds—the lower and upper limits—between which the true parameter is likely to lie.
   - **Example**: Suppose you calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of slices of pizza eaten to be \([4.1, 6.5]\). This means you are 95% confident that the true average number of slices eaten by all patrons (the population mean) is between 4.1 and 6.5 slices.

### 3. **Why 95%?**
   - The 95% confidence level is a common choice because it balances the trade-off between precision and confidence. A higher confidence level (e.g., 99%) would result in a wider interval, providing more certainty but less precision. Conversely, a lower confidence level (e.g., 90%) would result in a narrower interval, offering more precision but less certainty.

### 4. **How Is It Constructed?**
   - **For the Mean**: To construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean, you typically:
     1. **Calculate the Sample Mean (\( \bar{X} \))**: The average of your sample data.
     2. **Determine the Standard Error (SE)**: The standard deviation of the sample mean, often calculated as \( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \), where \( s \) is the sample standard deviation, and \( n \) is the sample size.
     3. **Find the Critical Value**: Use the appropriate z-score or t-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level (which is usually 1.96 for the z-score if the sample size is large, or the t-score for smaller samples).
     4. **Calculate the Interval**: Add and subtract the margin of error (which is the critical value times the standard error) from the sample mean to find the lower and upper bounds of the interval.

   \[
   \text{CI} = \bar{X} \pm (\text{Critical Value} \times \text{Standard Error})
   \]

### 5. **What It Does NOT Mean**
   - **Not a Probability Statement About the Population Parameter**: The 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this interval. The true mean is fixed, and the interval either contains it or it does not. The 95% refers to the long-run proportion of such intervals that would contain the true mean if we repeated the sampling process indefinitely.
   - **Not the Only Interval**: Different samples will yield different confidence intervals. The interval you calculate is just one of many that could be calculated from different samples.

### Summary

Constructing a 95% confidence interval means calculating a range of values from your sample data that you are 95% confident contains the true population parameter. This interval helps to express the uncertainty associated with your estimate, providing a more comprehensive understanding than a single point estimate like the sample mean.

The correct answer is "True" for the problem in the picture for the following reasons:

### 1. **Uniform Distribution on \([0, \theta]\)**
   - The problem states that the \( X_i \)s have a uniform distribution on the interval \([0, \theta]\). In a uniform distribution, every value between 0 and \( \theta \) is equally likely, and the mean of this distribution is \( \frac{\theta}{2} \).

### 2. **Sample Mean as an Estimator**
   - The mean of a uniform distribution on \([0, \theta]\) is \( \frac{\theta}{2} \). Given the sample mean \( \bar{X} \), you can estimate \( \theta \) using \( \hat{\theta} = 2\bar{X} \). This makes \( 2\bar{X} \) a reasonable point estimate for the true value of \( \theta \).

### 3. **Sample Variance is Known**
   - The problem mentions that the sample variance was computed and retained. Even though the original data is lost, the sample mean and variance are sufficient statistics for constructing a confidence interval in this context.

### 4. **Confidence Interval for the Mean**
   - A confidence interval can still be constructed using the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) and the fact that the sample comes from a uniform distribution. The key is that the mean of the distribution is \( \frac{\theta}{2} \), and with \( \hat{\theta} = 2\bar{X} \), you can establish a confidence interval around \( \frac{\hat{\theta}}{2} = \bar{X} \).

### 5. **Uniform Distribution Properties**
   - In a uniform distribution, the variance \( \text{Var}(X) \) can be related to the range \( \theta \) as \( \text{Var}(X) = \frac{\theta^2}{12} \). Knowing the sample variance allows for further refinement of the estimate of \( \theta \), if needed, although in this context, the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) alone is sufficient for estimating \( \theta \) and constructing the interval.

### 6. **Sufficient Statistics**
   - In statistical theory, sufficient statistics (like the sample mean in this case) contain all the information needed about a parameter (here, \( \theta \)) that can be gleaned from the sample. Therefore, even though the original data is lost, the sample mean provides all the necessary information to estimate \( \theta \) and construct the confidence interval.

### Summary

Given the uniform distribution on \([0, \theta]\), the retained sample mean is a sufficient statistic for estimating the population mean. Despite losing the original data, you can use the sample mean to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean of the \( X_i \)s, making the statement "True." The key reasons are the properties of the uniform distribution, the sufficiency of the sample mean, and the relationship between the sample mean and the parameter \( \theta \).
