### Context of the Problem

The problem involves determining the confidence interval for the average number of pizza slices eaten by patrons at a Scrabble pizza party. Since you do not know the exact number of pizzas to order, you decide to estimate the number of slices each person would eat by performing a poll on ten randomly selected patrons. The data collected are the number of slices each person ate.

### Specific Terms, Math Expressions, and Notations

1. **\( \bar{X} \)**: The sample mean.
   - **Expression**: \( \bar{X} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=1}^{10} X_i = 4.3 \)
   - **Explanation**: The average number of slices eaten by the ten sampled patrons. In this case, the average is 4.3 slices.

2. **\( s^2 \)**: The sample variance.
   - **Expression**: \( s^2 = \frac{1}{9} \sum_{i=1}^{10} (X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 2.7 \)
   - **Explanation**: The variance in the number of slices eaten, which measures how spread out the data is around the mean. Here, the variance is 2.7 slices squared.

3. **Confidence Interval**:
   - **Expression**: \( \bar{X} \pm t_{0.025, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \)
   - **Explanation**: This formula is used to calculate the 95% confidence interval, which estimates the range in which the true mean number of slices eaten by all patrons likely falls. The value \( t_{0.025, n-1} \) is the t-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level with 9 degrees of freedom (since there are 10 samples, \( n-1 = 9 \)).

4. **Lower Bound and Upper Bound**:
   - **Expressions**: 
     - Lower Bound \( a = 4.3 - 2.26 \times \frac{\sqrt{2.7}}{\sqrt{10}} = 3.12 \)
     - Upper Bound \( b = 4.3 + 2.26 \times \frac{\sqrt{2.7}}{\sqrt{10}} = 5.48 \)
   - **Explanation**: These bounds define the range of the confidence interval. It means that with 95% confidence, the true average number of slices eaten by all patrons lies between 3.12 and 5.48 slices.

### Explanation with an Analogy and a Quantitative Example

**Analogy**:
Imagine you are trying to estimate the average number of candies eaten by children at a party. Instead of asking every child, you select ten children at random and ask them how many candies they ate. You calculate the average and also determine how much variation there is in the number of candies each child ate. Using this information, you want to figure out a range (interval) that you're 95% sure contains the true average number of candies eaten by all children at the party.

**Quantitative Example**:
Let's say the ten children you surveyed ate the following number of candies: 2, 3, 5, 4, 4, 6, 3, 5, 2, and 8. You calculate:
- The **sample mean** \( \bar{X} \) as \( 4.3 \) candies.
- The **sample variance** \( s^2 \) as \( 2.7 \) candies squared.

You want to be 95% confident in your estimate of the average number of candies eaten by all the children at the party, so you calculate the confidence interval. After looking up the appropriate t-score for 9 degrees of freedom (which is approximately 2.26), you apply the formula to find:

- **Lower Bound**: \( 3.12 \) candies.
- **Upper Bound**: \( 5.48 \) candies.

Thus, you can be 95% confident that the true average number of candies eaten by all children at the party is between 3.12 and 5.48 candies.

### Core Concepts Required to Solve the Problem

1. **Sample Mean (\( \bar{X} \))**:
   - The average value of a set of data points.
   - Formula: \( \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \)

2. **Sample Variance (\( s^2 \))**:
   - A measure of how much the data points differ from the sample mean.
   - Formula: \( s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \)

3. **Standard Error of the Mean (SE)**:
   - An estimate of the standard deviation of the sample mean.
   - Formula: \( SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \)

4. **t-Distribution**:
   - Used instead of the normal distribution when the sample size is small (typically \( n < 30 \)).
   - The t-distribution is characterized by degrees of freedom (\( df = n - 1 \)).

5. **Confidence Interval**:
   - A range of values that is likely to contain the population mean with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval).
   - Formula: \( \bar{X} \pm t_{(\alpha/2, n-1)} \times SE \)

### Detailed Steps to Obtain the Final Solution

**Given Data**:
- \( \bar{X} = 4.3 \) (Sample Mean)
- \( s^2 = 2.7 \) (Sample Variance)
- \( n = 10 \) (Sample Size)
- Confidence Level = 95%

1. **Calculate the Standard Deviation (\( s \))**:
   \[
   s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{2.7} \approx 1.643
   \]

2. **Determine the Standard Error of the Mean (SE)**:
   \[
   SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.643}{\sqrt{10}} \approx \frac{1.643}{3.162} \approx 0.519
   \]

3. **Identify the t-Score for 95% Confidence Level**:
   - Degrees of Freedom (\( df \)) = \( n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 \)
   - Using a t-table, the t-score for \( df = 9 \) at a 95% confidence level (two-tailed) is approximately \( t_{0.025, 9} = 2.262 \).

4. **Calculate the Confidence Interval**:
   \[
   \text{Confidence Interval} = \bar{X} \pm t_{(\alpha/2, n-1)} \times SE
   \]
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Lower Bound} = 4.3 - 2.262 \times 0.519 \approx 4.3 - 1.173 \approx 3.127
   \]
   \[
   \text{Upper Bound} = 4.3 + 2.262 \times 0.519 \approx 4.3 + 1.173 \approx 5.473
   \]

5. **Round the Final Results**:
   - The final confidence interval bounds should be rounded to two decimal places as requested.
   \[
   \text{Lower Bound} = 3.12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Upper Bound} = 5.48
   \]

### Final Solution:

The 95% confidence interval for the mean number of pizza slices eaten by all patrons is \([3.12, 5.48]\). This means that you can be 95% confident that the true average number of slices eaten by all patrons lies between 3.12 and 5.48 slices.

The statement "Assuming that the \( X_i \)s are i.i.d. normal" refers to specific assumptions about the random variables \( X_i \) (in this case, the number of pizza slices eaten by each individual in the sample). Let’s break down what each part of this phrase means:

### 1. **Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.)**:
- **Independent**: Each \( X_i \) is independent of the others. This means that the number of pizza slices one person eats does not influence or provide any information about how many slices another person eats. Mathematically, this implies that the joint probability distribution of the variables can be factored into the product of their individual distributions.
  
- **Identically Distributed**: Each \( X_i \) follows the same probability distribution. In this case, all the \( X_i \)s are drawn from the same distribution, which means each individual in the sample has the same likelihood of eating a given number of slices, according to a common distribution.

### 2. **Normal Distribution**:
- The statement also specifies that the \( X_i \)s follow a **normal distribution**. This is a specific type of probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean, and it is characterized by two parameters:
  - **Mean (\( \mu \))**: The average number of pizza slices expected.
  - **Standard Deviation (\( \sigma \))**: The measure of spread around the mean.

The normal distribution is often depicted as a bell-shaped curve, where most of the data points are close to the mean, and fewer points are further away as you move towards the tails of the distribution.

### Summary:

When the problem states, "Assuming that the \( X_i \)s are i.i.d. normal," it means:

1. Each \( X_i \) (number of slices eaten by each individual) is an independent observation from the others.
2. Each \( X_i \) comes from the same normal distribution, meaning they all have the same mean and variance.
3. The normal distribution is a specific probability distribution that is symmetric, unimodal (having one peak), and described by its mean and variance.

### Why This Assumption Matters:
This assumption is crucial for the validity of the confidence interval calculation:
- **Independence** ensures that the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) is a reliable estimator of the population mean.
- **Identical distribution** ensures that the sample mean and variance are consistent estimators.
- **Normality** allows the use of the t-distribution to estimate the confidence interval for the mean, especially when the sample size is small.

If these assumptions were not met, the confidence interval calculated might not be accurate or meaningful.

### t-Table

The **t-table** (also known as the Student's t-distribution table) is a reference table used in statistics to determine the critical value (t-score) needed to calculate confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests when dealing with small sample sizes. The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution but has heavier tails, meaning it accounts for more variability in the data, which is particularly useful when the sample size is small.

#### Key Components of a t-Table:
1. **Degrees of Freedom (df)**:
   - This is the number of independent values in a dataset that are free to vary when calculating a statistic, such as the sample variance. For a sample of size \( n \), the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution is \( df = n - 1 \).
   
2. **Significance Level (\( \alpha \))**:
   - The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It’s used to find the critical value in the table. For a confidence level of 95%, the significance level \( \alpha = 0.05 \).

3. **t-Scores**:
   - The values in the t-table correspond to the number of standard errors away from the mean that a certain percentage of the data lies within. These values are used to construct confidence intervals or test hypotheses.

To use a t-table, you look up the t-score corresponding to your desired confidence level and degrees of freedom.

### 95% Confidence Level (Two-Tailed)

The **95% confidence level** is a statistical term that indicates that if you were to take 100 different samples and compute a confidence interval for each sample, approximately 95 of the intervals would contain the true population parameter (like the mean), while 5 would not.

#### Two-Tailed Test:
- **Two-tailed** refers to the fact that the confidence interval or hypothesis test considers both extremes (tails) of the distribution. This is applicable when you are interested in whether the true parameter lies outside the range on either side of the sample statistic.

For example, with a 95% confidence level in a two-tailed test, you’re interested in the middle 95% of the distribution, leaving 2.5% in each tail. This means:
- **Lower Tail**: 2.5% of the distribution lies below a certain negative t-score.
- **Upper Tail**: 2.5% of the distribution lies above a certain positive t-score.

#### How to Use the t-Table for a 95% Confidence Level (Two-Tailed):
1. **Degrees of Freedom**: Determine your \( df \), which is typically \( n - 1 \) for a single sample mean.
   
2. **t-Score Lookup**: In the t-table, find the row corresponding to your \( df \), and then locate the column that represents a 95% confidence level for a two-tailed test (usually labeled under \( t_{0.025} \) for a two-tailed test since \( \alpha = 0.05 \) and is split between the two tails).
   
3. **Apply the t-Score**: Use this t-score to calculate the confidence interval:
   \[
   \text{Confidence Interval} = \bar{X} \pm t \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
   \]

### Example Application:

- **Given**: You have a sample size \( n = 10 \) and want to calculate a 95% confidence interval.
- **Degrees of Freedom**: \( df = n - 1 = 9 \).
- **t-Score**: Look up \( df = 9 \) and \( \alpha/2 = 0.025 \) in the t-table, and you find a t-score of approximately \( 2.262 \).
- **Confidence Interval Calculation**: If your sample mean \( \bar{X} = 4.3 \) and standard error \( SE = 0.519 \), then the interval is:
   \[
   4.3 \pm 2.262 \times 0.519
   \]
   This gives you the confidence interval \([3.12, 5.48]\).

The 95% confidence level means that if you repeated this process many times, about 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true population mean.
